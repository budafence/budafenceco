            <h2 class="py-4 font-bold text-2xl">When Do You Need a Fence Permit in Austin?</h2>

            <p class="pb-6">
                One of the most common questions homeowners have is whether or not they need a permit to build a fence in Austin. The answer depends on several factors, including the height of the fence and its location. According to the City of Austin, a fence requires a permit if it meets any of the following criteria:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Is located in a floodplain:</strong> If your property is situated in a designated floodplain, you will need a permit for any fence construction. You can check if your property is in a floodplain by visiting the <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/floodpro" class="text-blue-500 hover:underline">City of Austin's Floodpro webpage</a>.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Is more than 7 feet high at any point:</strong> Any fence exceeding 7 feet in height requires a permit. This rule applies to the entire length of the fence, so even if only a small portion is over 7 feet, a permit is necessary.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Is more than 6 feet high for residential property along a public right-of-way (ROW):</strong> If your fence is adjacent to a public right-of-way, such as a sidewalk or street, and is taller than 6 feet, you will need a permit. This regulation does not apply to fences along a public alley.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="pb-6">
                It's important to note that even if your fence does not require a permit, it must still comply with all other applicable city codes and regulations. These regulations cover aspects like fence materials, safe construction practices, and property line setbacks.
            </p>

            <h3 class="py-4 font-bold text-xl">What is Regulated?</h3>

            <p class="pb-6">
                The City of Austin regulates several aspects of fence construction to ensure safety and consistency. These regulations apply to all fences, regardless of whether a permit is required. Key regulated areas include:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Fence Height:</strong> As mentioned earlier, there are specific height restrictions that determine if a permit is needed. Even if a permit is not required, your fence cannot exceed certain height limits, which vary depending on the location of the fence on your property.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Materials:</strong> The city has guidelines on the types of materials that can be used for fencing. Prohibited materials include barbed wire, electrified wire, and other hazardous options.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Setbacks:</strong> There are rules about how close your fence can be to property lines, sidewalks, and streets. These setbacks are in place to ensure public safety and access.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Visibility at Intersections:</strong> Fences located near street corners must not obstruct the view of drivers. This is known as the "visibility triangle" and is crucial for preventing accidents.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="py-4 font-bold text-xl">What is Not Regulated?</h3>

            <p class="pb-6">
                While the City of Austin has many regulations for fences, there are some aspects that are not under its jurisdiction. These include:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Disputes between neighbors:</strong> The city does not get involved in disputes between property owners about fences, such as disagreements over the cost of a shared fence or its appearance.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Deed restrictions:</strong> Your neighborhood or homeowners' association (HOA) may have its own set of rules for fences, which are separate from the city's regulations. You should always check with your HOA before building a fence.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="py-4 font-bold text-2xl">Safe Fencing Requirements</h2>

            <p class="pb-6">
                In 2023, the Austin City Council passed updated "Safe Fencing" requirements to make fences less dangerous for children and wildlife. These rules apply to all new fences and some existing fences. The key requirements include:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Prohibition of hazardous features:</strong> The new ordinance prohibits features that can cause injury, such as sharp pickets, pointed tops, and closely spaced vertical bars that can trap a child's head.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Wildlife-friendly design:</strong> The regulations encourage the use of wildlife-friendly fencing that allows animals to pass through safely. This includes having gaps at the bottom of the fence and avoiding materials that can entangle animals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="py-4 font-bold text-2xl">Other Regulations That Affect Fence Design</h2>

            <p class="pb-6">
                In addition to the specific fence regulations, other city codes can impact your fence project. These include:
            </p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Swimming pool and spa code:</strong> If you are building a fence around a swimming pool or spa, it must comply with specific safety requirements, such as being at least 4 feet high and having a self-closing, self-latching gate.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Utility easements:</strong> You cannot build a fence in a way that blocks access to utility easements. These are areas of your property that utility companies have the right to access for maintenance and repairs.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="py-4 font-bold text-2xl">How to Apply for a Fence Permit</h2>

            <p class="pb-6">
                If your fence project requires a permit, you will need to submit an application to the City of Austin's Development Services Department. The application process typically involves the following steps:
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-6">
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Gather the required documents:</strong> You will need to provide a site plan showing the location, height, and materials of the fence, as well as a property survey.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Complete the application form:</strong> The residential fence permit application form can be found on the City of Austin's website.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Submit the application and pay the fee:</strong> You can submit your application online or in person. There is a fee for the permit, which varies depending on the scope of the project.</li>
                <li class="mb-2"><strong>Schedule an inspection:</strong> Once your permit is approved, you will need to schedule an inspection to ensure that your fence is built according to the approved plans.</li>
            </ol>
